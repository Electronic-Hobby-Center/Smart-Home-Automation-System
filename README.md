# Smart Home Controller System

## For an easily integrable smart home

-  This repo is more like a demo of the web controller system, but the whole system can scale and easily integrate with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa
-  Built with Bolt Cloud
-  Uses [Bulma](https://bulma.io) and [Bulma-switch](https://wikiki.github.io/form/switch)
-  Special thanks to [Katerina Limpitsouni](https://undraw.co/) for amazing illustrations, which we've edited and used

## You also can set up your BoltIoT device to use this

### Current Setup

-  You need to upload code into [Bolt Cloud](https://cloud.boltiot.com)
-  Current setup is light at pin 0, TV at pin 2, fan at pin 1 and temperature sensor at pin A0. But you can change that in index.js
-  Light and TV are just for example, it can be any on-off device

### Or new website

-  You can use [BoltIoT-fetch-wrapper](https://github.com/RoneelV/BoltIoT-fetch-wrapper) to make API requests hasslefree
